# JXcore Version Manager

Allows to install JXcore published binaries (available also on JXcore [download page](http://jxcore.com/downloads/))

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install -g jxvm-dev
```

OR, if you have JXcore already installed:

```bash
$ jx install -g jxvm-dev
```

In case of `Error: EACCES` try the command with `sudo`.

### Usage

Once installed, you may use `jxvm` to manage JXcore versions.

$ jxvm use 0304
```
